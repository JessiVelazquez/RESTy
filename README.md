# Overview

This is a basic application built in React.js that will ultimately enable users to hit an http route with a GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE method request. Once completed, this will be a Postman/Swagger clone with similar functionality. For now, all we are doing is taking the user's input for URL and method request, saving those as state, and then displaying those back to the user below the form input.

This is displayed in real time without a page refresh because we are utilizing state management in React.js.
